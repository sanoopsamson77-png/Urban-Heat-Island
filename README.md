# Urban-Heat-Island
Urban Heat Island Analyzer is a satellite-driven web application that visualizes Land Surface Temperature (LST), detects urban heat islands, and analyzes the relationship between vegetation and heat using Google Earth Engine and Landsat thermal data.


Deployment Note
This project uses a Python (Flask) backend integrated with Google Earth Engine.
GitHub Pages hosts only the frontend; backend APIs are not available on static hosting.
Full functionality is demonstrated in the demo video.
